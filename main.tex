\begin{abstract}
%The Abstract (250 words maximum) should be structured to include the following details: \textbf{Background}, the context and purpose of the study; \textbf{Results}, the main findings; \textbf{Conclusions}, brief summary and potential implications. Please minimize the use of abbreviations and do not cite references in the abstract.
\textbf{Background:} Hands-on training, whether in Bioinformatics or other domains, requires significant resources and knowledge to setup and run.
Trainers must have access to powerful compute infrastructure that can support resource intensive jobs running efficiently.
Often times this is achieved via running on a private server where there is no contention for the queue. However, this places a significant pre-requisite knowledge barrier for teachers, who must spend time learning deployment and management of compute resources. Orthogonally, with the advent of hybrid teaching, with groups in separate physical locations, it is difficult or impossible to track student progress as efficiently as during in-person courses, leading to delays.

\textbf{Findings:} Originally developed by Galaxy Europe and the Gallantries, together with the Galaxy community we have jointly developed and iterated upon the concept of Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS) over the past 4 years in order to provide convenient training infrastructure to the world. The service provides free, dedicated training resources for Galaxy based courses and events. Event organisers must register their course, after which trainees are transparently placed in a private queue. Trainers can follow student progress via the built in dashboard.

\textbf{Conclusions:} TIaaS provides a significant improvement for trainers and trainees, as well as infrastructure administrators. The instructor dashboard makes remote events not only possible but easy. Students experience continuity of learning, as all training happens on the public Galaxy which they can continue to use after the event. In the past 24 months, $>360$ trainings with over 18,000 trainees have used this infrastructure for Galaxy training.

\section{Findings}
\subsection{Background}

% The background section should be written in a way that is accessible to researchers without specialist knowledge in that area and must clearly state---and, if helpful, illustrate---the background to the research and its aims. The section should end with a brief statement of what is being reported in the article.

With the volume of bioinformatics data becoming available, the availability of training for bioinformaticians is not keeping up (\cite{Attwood2017}).
The Galaxy platform \cite{afgan2018galaxy} provides one such infrastructure on which to conduct trainings, as it provides a user-friendly web-based interface to command line tools, decreasing infrastructure preparation time. With a wide range of tools across bioinformatics domains and beyond, and pre-existing popularity within the life sciences community, it is an ideal platform for training (\cite{gtn}).

The Galaxy community has developed a wide array of hands-on training materials (275+) covering bioinformatics and beyond (\cite{training-site}) in an attempt to combat this issue, but in order to run these tutorials at scale, one often needs access to significant resources. The GTN's most popular tutorial, ``Reference-based RNA-Seq data analysis'', uses the STAR aligner (\cite{Dobin2012}). While an ultra-fast aligner is ideal during training, it also consumes $\approx$32 GB of RAM at minimum\footnote{It uses 90Gb in the default configuration on UseGalaxy.eu. Many tools have similar requirements; on UseGalaxy.eu, 83 tools require $>$64 GB RAM, 151 require more than $>$32 GB, a limiting factor especially for smaller training infrastructures. Even with a large cluster, many trainees can still consume all of the available overhead.}. While individual STAR jobs might execute successfully, the infrastructure remains a limiting factor for events of any size that wish to stick to a schedule. When jobs must queue due to throughput limitations, this significantly impacts a training's timeline to the detriment of students. While the teacher could alternatively deploy their own private infrastructure, this requires significant additional knowledge, time, energy, and funds. All significant barriers for bioinformatics trainers trying to share their knowledge.

During one of the initial Gallantries events, which was the first foray for UseGalaxy.eu trainers into hybrid training--wherein we had three classrooms spread across the Netherlands, Germany, and Greece--we discovered that staying updated on student progress was a significant pain point. Normally teachers of hands on lessons tend to wander around the classroom to check that students are not encountering difficulties, or use the Carpentries method of red and green post-it notes to let students communicate if things are going well or poorly. This was difficult in this situation as on-site staff needed to survey they room and report back centrally to the teacher, however it was completely impossible in fully remote training events such as have been occurring for the last 3 years of the pandemic.

\subsection{Results}

We initially developed Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS) initially to solve our primary problems of ensuring we could quickly setup training resources which would be private to a single course. By re-using an existing public server backed by significant compute resources, we completely remove the infrastructure setup and maintenance costs of hosting an event for trainers. This centralisation also reduces the infrastructure requirements, as trainings are rarely concurrent and can share the same hardware when not running simultaneously. While individual TIaaS deployments can handle job scheduling differently, they generally allocate private resources so jobs can always run without delay. Lastly, provides good separation of responsibilities between trainers who are teaching and the server administrators responsible for Galaxy, rather than requiring teachers to be cross-trained in server administration. The live dashboard showing student jobs provides unparalleled visibility into student progress and any potential issues a teacher should discuss with students. We have shared this service with the Galaxy training community to overwhelmingly positive feedback.

\caption{The top of the training dashboard page shows the status of the jobs in the past hours. A heatmap of the tools which were run indiciates if everything is running smoothly or if there is anything the trainer should look into. As trainees follow along and run different tools these show up immediately, allowing trainers to identify if everyone has started or finished a specific step.. The bottom image shows the rest of the training dashboard, which lists jobs that were run chronologically, colour coded first by user, and second by the job status. Randomized colours are used to protect user privacy, as we wanted dashboards to be visible to course members.}\label{figure:dashboard}
\end{figure}

We implemented a web service, and separately job scheduling rules, which function together to present a private queue for users in specific Galaxy user groups. Trainers register their course and teaching materials with an online form in the web service. Administrators review training requests, using information about their class size, the tools used in those training materials, and the resource allocations of those tools on the infrastructure to estimate the required compute resources.

If space is available and any other site specific criteria is met, the training can then be approved. Next, administrators (optionally) deploy additional private compute resources, or re-allocate existing resources, in a local compute environment and attach them to their existing Galaxy scheduling, via the job scheduling rules. Administrators can then provide trainers with a URL such as \url{https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/test}, and the trainer can then in turn provide to their trainees. When training participants access the URL, they are registered in the TIaaS system, without the service administrator or trainers needing to be aware of users identities to aid in privacy protection\footnote{Local deployments can choose to disable that, e.g. for Galaxies deployed within a university or highschool where attendee privacy is not a requirement.}. The job scheduler, once aware of the training group, will place any job run by someone in that training onto the private training nodes (Figure \ref{figure:queue}).

\begin{figure}[bt!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/rules.png}
\caption{Schematic of the idealised TIaaS queuing system. Jobs are processed by the same Galaxy server, but when those jobs come from users in the training group, they receive special handling. These jobs are allowed to run on the private training resources (purple). If the training resource is full, these jobs can spill over to the main queue if necessary.}\label{figure:queue}
\end{figure}

The course dashboard, visualising the progress of participants (Figure \ref{figure:dashboard}), has significantly improved the lives of trainers, especially situations involving remote participants. The dashboard provides instantaneous, aggregated, and pseudonymised feedback for the trainers into how their trainees are progressing. It has also enabled remote and hybrid trainings to take place, which were previously very labour intensive due to necessity of maintaining insight into potential issues across multiple locations. Requiring per-site helpers to regularly provide up-to-date information on how participants are progressing does not work effectively without very dedicated helpers. With the training dashboard, however, this is unnecessary as course staff can watch student progress in real time. Teachers can see if steps are completed successfully on average, or if there are many issues and they might need to pause or explain the step in more detail.

\subsubsection{Usage}
Since the introduction of TIaaS in July 2018, it has seen nearly constant use with more than $>$360 trainings occurring on the platform, all across the world.% (Figure \ref{figure:map}).
Everything from one day workshops for bioinformaticians to multi-month courses for highschool students have been hosted by TIaaS and UseGalaxy.eu, covering topics as wide-ranging as SARS-CoV-2 analysis, Imaging, Proteomics, and Machine Learning. All of this infrastructure has been provided for free across the big three Galaxies (EU, Americas, Australia), in thanks to the various grants supporting their associated Galaxy deployments.

% \end{figure}

Class sizes have ranged considerably, from the median of 15 participants to a maximum of 3000 registrants at a fully asynchronous course. Most courses were short training events with a median of two days, however some ran for multiple months like a number of highschool courses which used TIaaS over the entire semester. The variability in administrator deployments of TIaaS can allow it to accommodate a wide range of teaching scenarios; for some courses large resources may be allocated like the Galaxy Community Conferences where the big three Galaxies configured TIaaS with considerable resources to permit local and remote synchronous training, all the way to semester long courses which may not necessitate a large amount of resources.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Implementation}
TIaaS was written in Python with the Django framework. It has been designed from the start to have a very limited scope: provide a form to register events, an approval flow for administrators, management of user groups and roles in the Galaxy database, and the status dashboard.

For instructors a form is provided (\texttt{/tiaas/new}) which permits them to register a new training event. When submitted, this is stored in the associated database. Administrators can view the requested training events and approve or reject them using the built in Django admin interface. When users visit their their training url (\texttt{/join-training/<id>}) the system accesses their Galaxy session cookie, which is present as TIaaS is deployed at a path below Galaxy, and decodes it. They are automatically registered as part of a Galaxy group named after the training (e.g. \texttt{training-<id>}) which is created on demand.

When visiting the dashboard (Figure \ref{figure:dashboard}), the training ID is extracted from the URL (e.g. ``test'' from \url{https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/test/status}), and all non-terminal jobs, in the past 1-6 hours, from those users are presented in a pseudonymised manner.

\subsubsection{Scheduling}
When a job is submitted by a user in a training group, the Galaxy instance's job scheduling system system reads the user's groups and roles, and if any of these include something prefixed with \texttt{training-}, then this is converted to a job scheduler specific requirement string (Figure \ref{code:scheduler}, \ref{code:tpv}). Ideally these are scheduled to prefer training nodes, and spill over to the main queue if training nodes are full, but this feature is dependant on specific scheduler capabilities.

\subsubsection{Overview Pages}
Information over the status of the TIaaS system is provided via the interface. The calendar page made with Vue.js (e.g. \url{https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/calendar/}) shows upcoming training events, as well as their details if one is logged in as a TIaaS administrator. This is complemented by the stats view (e.g. \url{https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/stats/}) which shows overall system statistics giving funding agencies and staff a live view of the impact their service is having on the community and world.

    return job

\end{figure}

\subsection{Deploying}
As the Galaxy community has largely settled on Ansible for deployment of Galaxy, and related components, an Ansible role was produced for deploying the TIaaS Service. A few known deployments make their configuration public, and we can see the differences: one the motivating factor in TIaaS' design was such flexibility. \emph{Galaxy Europe} uses it with HTCondor, and job rules that allow spill over to the main cluster, new machines are brought up in an OpenStack cluster specifically for training events and destroyed afterwards. Each Machine is tagged with an HTCondor attribute indicating which training it belongs to, and the job rules\footnote{Visible in \url{https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/pull/447/files}} use that to enable access to those machines, and a preference for them. \emph{Galaxy Australia} has a separate ``training cluster'' in their OpenStack deployment, and route all training jobs to the single shared cluster\footnote{Visible at \url{https://github.com/cat-bro/infrastructure/blob/81ce910b74aafb333085e5fbc42fe5b37c3b4cab/files/galaxy/dynamic_job_rules/pawsey/total_perspective_vortex/roles.yml}}. \emph{Galaxy Main} takes a different approach, lacking additional clusters but having an excellent queuing system, they artificially limit the runtime, memory, and CPU resources allocated to users running jobs within a TIaaS group. \emph{Avans Hogeschool} uses TIaaS in an internal Galaxy where they provide no preferential treatment, and just use the dashboard to observe students.
