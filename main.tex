\begin{abstract}
%The Abstract (250 words maximum) should be structured to include the following details: \textbf{Background}, the context and purpose of the study; \textbf{Results}, the main findings; \textbf{Conclusions}, brief summary and potential implications. Please minimize the use of abbreviations and do not cite references in the abstract.
\textbf{Background:} Hands-on training, whether in bioinformatics or other domains, often requires significant technical resources and knowledge to set up and run.
Instructors must have access to powerful compute infrastructure that can support resource-intensive jobs running efficiently.
Often this is achieved using a private server where there is no contention for the queue. However, this places a significant prerequisite knowledge or labour barrier for instructors, who must spend time coordinating deployment and management of compute resources. Somewhat orthogonally, with the increase of virtual and hybrid teaching, where learners are located in separate physical locations, it is difficult to track student progress as efficiently as during in-person courses.

\textbf{Findings:} Originally developed by Galaxy Europe and the Gallantries project, together with the Galaxy community we have created Training-Infrastructure-as-a-Service (TIaaS), aimed at providing user-friendly training infrastructure to the global training community. TIaaS provides dedicated training resources for Galaxy-based courses and events. Event organisers register their course, after which trainees are transparently placed in a private queue on the compute infrastructure, which ensures jobs complete quickly, even when the main queue is experiencing high wait times. A built-in dashboard allows instructors to monitor student progress.

\textbf{Conclusions:} TIaaS provides a significant improvement for instructors and learners, as well as infrastructure administrators. The instructor dashboard makes remote events not only possible but easy. Students experience continuity of learning, as all training happens on Galaxy which they can continue to use after the event. In the past 48 months, \input{inc.events.tex} training events with over \input{inc.learners.tex} learners have used this infrastructure for Galaxy training.

\section{Findings}
\subsection{Background}

% The background section should be written in a way that is accessible to researchers without specialist knowledge in that area and must clearly state---and, if helpful, illustrate---the background to the research and its aims. The section should end with a brief statement of what is being reported in the article.

With the large volume of bioinformatics data becoming available, the availability of training for bioinformaticians and data scientists is not keeping up, resulting in a training gap \cite{Attwood2017}.

The Galaxy platform \cite{afgan2018galaxy} provides infrastructure on which to not only perform data analysis, but also conduct trainings, as it provides a user-friendly web-based interface to command-line analysis tools. Teaching with Galaxy significantly decreases infrastructure preparation time for instructors \cite{gtn2}. With a wide range of tools (8,000+) across a broad range of scientific domains, and pre-existing popularity within the life sciences community, Galaxy is an ideal platform for training \cite{gtn,gtn2}.

In an attempt to address the training gap, the Galaxy community has, over the past several years, developed a large number of hands-on tutorials (300+)--covering bioinformatics and beyond--and made these materials FAIR \cite{Wilkinson2016-zo,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854}, and publicly available on the Galaxy Training Network (GTN) repository \cite{training-site}. In order to run these tutorials at scale, one often needs access to significant resources. For example, the GTN's most popular tutorial, ``Reference-based RNA-Seq data analysis'', uses the STAR aligner\cite{Dobin2012}. While such an ultra-fast aligner is ideal during training, as it reflects real-world analysis, it also consumes $\approx$32 GB of RAM at minimum\footnote{It uses 90 GB of RAM in the default configuration on UseGalaxy.eu. Many tools have similar requirements; on UseGalaxy.eu, 83 tools require $>$64 GB RAM, 151 require $>$32 GB, a limiting factor especially for smaller training infrastructures. Even with a large computer cluster, even moderate class sizes of 20-40 can still consume all of the available overhead.}. Individual STAR jobs might execute successfully and quickly, however the infrastructure remains a limiting factor for events with large number of participants, especially if they expect the class to remain on schedule. When jobs must queue due to throughput limitations, this negatively impacts a training's timeline, to the detriment of learners.

While the instructor could alternatively deploy their own private infrastructure, this requires additional knowledge, time, energy, and funds, all of which are significant barriers for bioinformatics instructors trying to teach a course. There are numerous attempts to decrease the effort required to deploy a Galaxy server such as Laniakea\cite{Tangaro_2020}, CloudLaunch\cite{Afgan_2019}, and AnVIL\cite{Schatz_2022}, most of these require access to a public or private cloud and a compute budget. Given the presence of numerous large Galaxy deployments that offer compute and data storage for free, a solution that can leverage these existing centres of Galaxy and system administration experience is highly desirable.

Lastly, with the advent of hybrid training--where an instructor is streamed live to multiple locations--and the pandemic forcing remote learning in many areas, tracking student progress became a significant issue. During one of the initial Gallantries \cite{gallantries} hybrid training events with three classrooms spread across Europe, we discovered that staying updated on student progress was one of the most significant pain points. Normally instructors of hands-on lessons tend to wander around the classroom to check that students are not encountering difficulties, or use the Carpentries-style \cite{thecarpentries,Wilson2016} method of red and green sticky notes to let students communicate whether things are going well or poorly. In hybrid events this progress tracking is more difficult as on-site staff need to survey the room and report back centrally to the instructor, and is near impossible in fully remote training events such as have been more prevalent during the last 3 years of the pandemic \cite{Serrano_Solano_2021}.

\subsection{Results}

We initially developed Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS) to solve our primary problems of ensuring we could quickly setup a private queue for a single course. It achieved this by segregating student jobs onto a separate group of compute nodes, based on their membership in a specific group in Galaxy.

By re-using an existing public server backed by significant compute resources, we completely removed the infrastructure setup and maintenance costs of hosting an event for instructors. This centralisation also reduced the infrastructure requirements, as training events are not highly concurrent and can share the same hardware when not running simultaneously.

The live dashboard (Figure~\ref{figure:dashboard}) showing participant jobs provides visibility into student progress and enables instructors to flag potential issues that may benefit from additional discussion with learners. We have shared this service with the Galaxy training community to overwhelmingly positive feedback, anecdotally \cite{tiaas_feedback}.

\subsubsection{Deployment}

The TIaaS system can be deployed on any Galaxy server, and by it's design is extremely flexible, allowing Galaxy administrators to customize the settings to fit their needs and compute infrastructure. TIaaS is currently deployed on all 3 major public Galaxy servers (Galaxy EU, Galaxy Australia, and Galaxy US), and numerous other smaller servers in public and private deployments. As compute infrastructures can be highly heterogeneous we do not prescribe a single preferred method in which to to preference training jobs. As a result administrators have generally allocated private resources so jobs can run without delay, with the exception of one site which preferences jobs by scheduling rules.

TIaaS provides a good separation of responsibilities between instructors who are teaching and the server administrators responsible for Galaxy and the compute infrastructure, rather than requiring either group to be cross-trained.

\begin{figure}[bt!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/dashboard.png}
\caption{The top portion of the training dashboard page shows the status of the jobs in the past hours. A greyscale heatmap of the tools which were run indicates if everything is running smoothly or if there is anything the instructors should look into. As learners follow along and run different tools, these show up immediately in the dashboard, allowing instructors to identify if everyone has started or finished a specific step. The bottom portion shows the rest of the training dashboard, which lists jobs and workflows that were run, chronologically, colour-coded first by user, and second by the job status. Randomised colours and identifiers are used to protect user privacy.}\label{figure:dashboard}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Development}

To create TIaaS, we implemented two components: a web service, and a default set of Galaxy job scheduling rules, which function together to present a private queue for users in specific Galaxy user groups. The web service enables registering requests for resources and an approval workflow for administrators. Additionally it handles creating groups in Galaxy and adding members to those groups as needed.

The registration form provided by the web service allows instructors to register requests for resources. There they are asked to provide information about the training materials they will use, and the expected number of participants. TIaaS coordinators or system administrators review these requests, using information about the class size, the tools used in the training materials, as well as the resource allocations of those tools on the infrastructure, to estimate the required compute resources.

If resources are available and any other site-specific criteria are met (e.g. any legal restrictions on what sort of trainings can be provided on grant funded infrastructure), then the training can be approved. Next, administrators (optionally) deploy additional private compute resources, or re-allocate existing resources to course usage. Administrators can then provide instructors with a URL such as \url{https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/test}, which the instructor can share with learners.

When training participants access the URL, they are automatically registered in the TIaaS system without user interaction or instructors needing to manually manage group membership. This aids in user privacy as the instructor does not need to collect user emails to manage their group, and learners can opt-in to joining the training group.

The job scheduler, once aware of the training group, will place any job run by someone in that training onto the private training nodes (Figure~\ref{figure:queue}).

\begin{figure}[bt!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/rules.png}
\caption{Schematic of the idealised TIaaS queuing system. Jobs are processed by the same Galaxy server, but when those jobs come from users in the training group, they receive special handling. These jobs are allowed to run on the private training resources (purple). If the training resource is full, these jobs can spill over to the main queue if necessary.}\label{figure:queue}
\end{figure}

The course dashboard, visualising the progress of participants (Figure~\ref{figure:dashboard}), has significantly improved the ability of instructors to monitor progress of the learners, especially in situations involving remote participants. The dashboard provides instantaneous, aggregated, and pseudonymised feedback for the instructors into how the learners are progressing. It has also simplified progress tracking in hybrid trainings, which were previously very labour intensive due to the necessity of maintaining insight into potential issues across multiple locations. This required per-site helpers to regularly update the instructor as to how participants were progressing. With the training dashboard however, the instructor is no longer dependent on these communications from the satellite locations, but can monitor progress via the dashboard themself, in real-time. Instructors can see which analysis steps are completed, and by how many of the participants. Whenever there are any issues (e.g. failed jobs), they can use this information to decide whether they need to pause or re-explain the step in more detail.

The most similar system the authors could find, that could be used for the same goal of monitoring student progress, is currently implemented in Nextflow. ``Nextflow Tower''\cite{nf-tower}, which permits launching and subsequently monitoring pipelines, could be used to cover a similar case of making sure students meet certain progress markers. However given that it works at the workflow level and not the individual step level, it may be less suited to the sort of \textit{ad hoc} analysis skills that are commonly taught using Galaxy, and more suited to either advanced students or those trainings which involve running pre-defined workflows. Snakemake has a similar, albeit single-user project called Panoptes that provides similar workflow tracking\cite{panoptes}, with the same downsides as Nextflow Tower, relative to TIaaS.

\subsubsection{Usage}
Since the introduction of TIaaS in July 2018, it has seen nearly constant use with \input{inc.events.tex} trainings occurring on the platform, all across the world (Figure~\ref{figure:graphs}).
Everything from one-day workshops for bioinformaticians to multi-month courses for high school and university students have all been hosted by these four TIaaS deployments, covering topics as wide-ranging as SARS-CoV-2 analysis, Imaging, Proteomics, and Machine Learning. All of this infrastructure has been provided for free across these four instances in the EU, France, the Americas, and Australia, thanks to the various grants supporting their associated Galaxy deployments.

\begin{figure}[bt!]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/event-starts.png}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/event-lengths.png}
	\caption{Since its introduction it has grown into a well-used service over the past four years. There have been 438 training events, primary hosted by the Australian and European instances which are both very involved in training. Event length distribution in days is extremely heavily skewed to very short events, with a long tail of semester-long courses using the platform.}\label{figure:graphs}
\end{figure}


Class sizes have ranged considerably, from the median of \input{inc.attend.median.tex} participants (std. dev \input{inc.attend.sd.tex}\unskip) to a maximum of \input{inc.attend.max.tex} registrants for a fully asynchronous (self-paced) course. Most courses were short training events with a median of two days, however some ran for multiple months like a number of high school or univeristy courses which used TIaaS over the entire semester. The variability in administrator deployments of TIaaS can allow it to accommodate a wide range of teaching scenarios; for some courses large resources may be allocated like the Galaxy Community Conferences where the big three Galaxies configured TIaaS with considerable resources to permit local and remote synchronous training, all the way to semester-long courses which may not necessitate a large allocation.

TIaaS has been successfully scaled to extremely large and highly geographically distributed events. The GT\~{N} project successfully used it for a Spanish language bioinformatics course spanning the Americas and Europe\cite{Spanscriptomics}, while the two Sm\"{o}rg\r{a}sbord events used TIaaS for a week long, global, asynchronous course with trainees across 111 countries\cite{SmorgBlog}.

In a hackathon environment, TIaaS has allowed large dataset (single cell RNA-seq) manipulation within group projects in remote courses with up to 30 participants performing unique analyses\cite{Bacon_2022}. It has successfully supported an introduction to bioinformatics course at a remote-learning, entrance-exam-free alternative education institution (The Open University) as well as industry courses, allowing them to test out Galaxy as a collaborative working environment before making decisions on consortium platform use.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Implementation}
TIaaS was written in Python with the Django framework \cite{django}. It has been designed from the start to have a very limited scope: provide a form to register events, an approval flow for administrators, management of user groups and roles in the Galaxy database, and the status dashboard. Service metrics are exposed via a Prometheus \cite{Prometheus} endpoint, e.g. \url{https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/metrics}, for visualisation and alerting.

Instructors can visit (\texttt{/tiaas/new}) to register a new event and request resources. When submitted, this form is stored in the associated database and administrators can view the requested training events and approve or reject them using the built in Django admin interface. When users visit their training URL (\texttt{/join-training/<id>}) the system accesses their Galaxy session cookie, which is present as TIaaS is deployed at a path below Galaxy, and decodes it, turning it into a Galaxy identity. This identity is then automatically associated with a Galaxy group named after the training (e.g. \texttt{training-<id>}) which is created on demand.

When visiting the dashboard (Figure~\ref{figure:dashboard}), the training ID is extracted from the URL (e.g. ``test'' from \url{https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/test/status}), and all jobs, in the past 0-6 hours, from those users are presented in a pseudonymised manner.

\subsubsection{Overview Pages}
Information over the status of the TIaaS system is provided via the interface. The calendar page made with Vue.js \cite{Vue} (e.g. \url{https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/calendar/}) and shows upcoming training events, as well as their details if one is logged in as a TIaaS administrator. This is complemented by the stats view (e.g. \url{https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/stats/}) which shows overall system statistics giving funding agencies and staff a live view of the impact their service is having on the global community.

\subsubsection{Scheduling}
When a job is submitted by a user in a training group, the Galaxy instance's job scheduling system reads the user's groups and roles, and if any of these include something prefixed with \texttt{training-}, then this is converted to a job scheduler specific requirement string (Figure~\ref{code:scheduler}, \ref{code:tpv}). Ideally these are scheduled to prefer training nodes, and spill over to the main queue if training nodes are full, but this feature is dependent on specific scheduler capabilities.

In HTCondor this can be accomplished by preventing regular jobs from running on training nodes (e.g. a Node's configuration including \texttt{Requirements=(GalaxyGroup == training-nld) || (GalaxyGroup == training-aus)}), and then allowing training jobs to run on training nodes, and preferring those nodes via configuration (e.g. a submit description including \texttt{+Group="training-aus, training-nld"})

Slurm, in contrast, requires either using TPV's notion of machine tags to separate jobs into those specific groups of machines, or simply manually selecting a reservation in which to run the training jobs, with \texttt{--partition=training-nld}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,language=Python]
def queue_job(job, user):
    job.cluster = 'main'

    if inTrainingGroup(user):
        training = getTrainingGroup(user)
        job.cluster = training

    return job
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Pseudocode representing how TIaaS jobs are typically processed and allocated to a private queue.\label{code:scheduler}}
\end{figure}

Or, rewritten for the modern Total Perspective Vortex (TPV)\cite{TPV} scheduler that is now being used at all three large UseGalaxy servers:

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,language=bash]
roles:
  training.*:
    scheduling:
      require:
        - training
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{YAML formatted TPV configuration that schedules jobs coming from users with a training role to any machines labelled as training nodes.\label{code:tpv}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Deploying}
As the Galaxy community has largely settled on Ansible for deployment of Galaxy, and related components, an Ansible role was produced for deploying the TIaaS Service. A few known deployments make their configuration public, and as such we can see what choices each administrator made. One of the motivating factors in TIaaS' design was such flexibility, this advantage is seen directly in those deployments.

\emph{Galaxy Europe} uses it with HTCondor, and job rules that allow spill over to the main cluster, new machines are brought up in an OpenStack cluster specifically for training events and destroyed afterwards. Each Machine is tagged with an HTCondor attribute indicating which training it belongs to, and the job rules\footnote{Visible in \url{https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/pull/447/files}} use that to enable access to those machines, and a preference for them.

\emph{Galaxy Australia} has a separate ``training cluster'' in their OpenStack deployment, and route all training jobs to the single shared cluster\footnote{Visible in \url{https://github.com/usegalaxy-au/infrastructure/tree/57cd80030d72929c263955e895079d6ac25aa24f/files/galaxy/dynamic_job_rules/production/total_perspective_vortex}, note the \texttt{training} role and destinations tagged training.}.

\emph{Galaxy US} takes a different approach, lacking additional clusters but having an efficient queuing system that can properly pack jobs based on walltimes; they instead artificially limit the runtime, memory, and CPU resources allocated to users running jobs within a TIaaS group. 

\emph{Avans Hogeschool} uses TIaaS in an internal Galaxy where they provide no preferential treatment, and just use the dashboard to follow students' progress\footnote{Visible at \url{https://github.com/Avans-ATGM/infrastructure/commit/11fa1ed38a7ed6640eafeca2ace8bb73e189301e}}.
