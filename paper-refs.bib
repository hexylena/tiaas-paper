Genome annotation projects have generally become small-scale affairs that are often carried out by an individual laboratory. Although annotating a eukaryotic genome assembly is now within the reach of non-experts, it remains a challenging task. Here we provide an overview of the genome annotation process and the available tools and describe some best-practice approaches.},

              stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies,
              and scholarly publishers-have come together to design and jointly
              endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer
              to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act
              as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of
              their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on
              the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on
              enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use
              the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.
              This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR
              Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some
              exemplar implementations in the community.",

    abstract = {Author summary Everything we do today is becoming more and more reliant on the use of computers. The field of biology is no exception; but most biologists receive little or no formal preparation for the increasingly computational aspects of their discipline. In consequence, informal training courses are often needed to plug the gaps; and the demand for such training is growing worldwide. To meet this demand, some training programs are being expanded, and new ones are being developed. Key to both scenarios is the creation of new course materials. Rather than starting from scratch, however, it’s sometimes possible to repurpose materials that already exist. Yet finding suitable materials online can be difficult: They’re often widely scattered across the internet or hidden in their home institutions, with no systematic way to find them. This is a common problem for all digital objects. The scientific community has attempted to address this issue by developing a set of rules (which have been called the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable [FAIR] principles) to make such objects more findable and reusable. Here, we show how to apply these rules to help make training materials easier to find, (re)use, and adapt, for the benefit of all.},
